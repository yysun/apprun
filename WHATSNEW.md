### What's New

## Default npm Version Change

In the past, the AppRun default version on npm is 1.x. The CLI creates tsconfig for es5. You can use --es6 option to create tsconfig for 2.x.

On Feb 21, 2020, the default version on npm has been changed from 1.x to 2.x. And the CLI creates tsconfig for es2015. You can use --es5 option for 1.x.

When upgrading projects to the latest version (2.x), please modify the tsconfig from targeting es5 to es2015.

Currently, the npm tags are as following:

* apprun@es5: 1.x, stable, es5
* apprun@latest: 2.x, stable, es2015, web components
* apprun@next: 3.x, dev, es2015, web components, lit-html
