# Dev Tools

There are many development tools that help you developing AppRun applications with productivity and quality.

## CLI in Console

We have been using the command line interface (CLI) in the terminal window and the command prompt. AppRun comes up with the idea of CLI in the console.

Also, check out the [unit testing](11-unit-testing) for how to use the CLI to generate unit tests.

## Redux Extensions

AppRun supports the Redux DevTools Extension. To use the dev-tools, install the [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension). You can monitor the events and states in the devtools.

## VS Code Extension

AppRun has a code snippet extension for VS Code that you can install from the extension marketplace. It inserts AppRun code template for application, component and event handling.
